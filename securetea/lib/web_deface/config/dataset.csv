Apache2 Default Page

It works!

This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the
Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the
equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived.
If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
this site is working properly. You should **replace this file** (located at
`/var/www/html/index.html`) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.

Configuration Overview

Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default
configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with
Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is **fully documented in
/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz**. Refer to this for the full
documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by
accessing the manual if the `apache2-doc` package was installed on this
server.

The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu
systems is as follows:

    
    
    /etc/apache2/
    |-- apache2.conf
    |       `--  ports.conf
    |-- mods-enabled
    |       |-- *.load
    |       `-- *.conf
    |-- conf-enabled
    |       `-- *.conf
    |-- sites-enabled
    |       `-- *.conf
              

  * `apache2.conf` is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. 
  * `ports.conf` is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. 
  * Configuration files in the `mods-enabled/`, `conf-enabled/` and `sites-enabled/` directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. 
  * They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers ` a2enmod, a2dismod, ` ` a2ensite, a2dissite, ` and ` a2enconf, a2disconf `. See their respective man pages for detailed information. 
  * The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to start/stop the service use `systemctl start apache2` and `systemctl stop apache2`, and use `systemctl status apache2` and `journalctl -u apache2` to check status. `system` and `apache2ctl` can also be used for service management if desired. **Calling` /usr/bin/apache2` directly will not work** with the default configuration. 

Document Roots

By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to _any_ file
outside of those located in `/var/www`, public_html directories (when enabled)
and `/usr/share` (for web applications). If your site is using a web document
root located elsewhere (such as in `/srv`) you may need to whitelist your
document root directory in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.

The default Ubuntu document root is `/var/www/html`. You can make your own
virtual hosts under /var/www.

Reporting Problems

Please use the `ubuntu-bug` tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with
Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.

Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to their
respective packages, not to the web server itself.
