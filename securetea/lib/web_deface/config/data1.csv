# How to handle AssertionError in Python and find out which line or statement

I want to handle `AssertionError`s both to hide unnecessary parts of the stack
trace from the user and to print a message as to why the error occurred and
what the user should do about it.

**Is there any way to find out on which line or statement the`assert` failed
within the `except` block?**

    
    
    try:
        assert True
        assert 7 == 7
        assert 1 == 2
        # many more statements like this
    except AssertionError:
        print 'Houston, we have a problem.'
        print
        print 'An error occurred on line ???? in statement ???'
        exit(1)
    

I don't want to have to add this to every assert statement:

    
    
    assert 7 == 7, ""7 == 7""
    

because it repeats information.

Two issues. First, if you are having trouble identifying where the exception
is happening in your `try..except`, that's a sign your `try..except` block is
too big. Second, the kind of thing meant to be caught by `assert` isn't
something the user should ever see. If they see an `AssertionError`, the
proper course of action is for them to contact the programmer and say ""WTF?!"".
– John Y Jul 20 '12 at 21:51

@John Y, you seem confused. You're saying `AssertionError`s shouldn't be seen
by the user, and then what the user should do when he sees one. It can't be
both! – devtk Jul 20 '12 at 22:18

  * 8

BTW: Asserts should be about the structure of your code, that is, an assert
should fail only if you have a bug in your software. They should not be used
to check user input. You might consider using a different exception for this
application. – Ned Batchelder Jul 21 '12 at 0:42

@NedBatchelder Thanks, you are correct. I may reconsider using asserts here,
but the procedure for getting the line code will still be useful. – devtk Jul
21 '12 at 0:54

  * @NedBatchelder Why should asserts not be used for user input validation? What alternatives are recommended? – Konrad Jul 19 at 21:38

Use the traceback module:

    
    
    import sys
    import traceback
    
    try:
        assert True
        assert 7 == 7
        assert 1 == 2
        # many more statements like this
    except AssertionError:
        _, _, tb = sys.exc_info()
        traceback.print_tb(tb) # Fixed format
        tb_info = traceback.extract_tb(tb)
        filename, line, func, text = tb_info[-1]
    
        print('An error occurred on line {} in statement {}'.format(line, text))
        exit(1)

  * How do I get the actual value instead of the line vars? e.g assert a == b I want to show the values of a and b. I tried sys.exc_info()[1] but it's empty – 0x2bad Jun 30 '19 at 19:46

  * @0x2bad Try `assert a == b, (a, b)`, which will give you the values in `sys.exc_info()[1].args[0]` – or easier, name the AssertionError you catch `ae`, then it's in `ae.args[0]`. You can also create a helper method which does the actual assertion. This is what `unittest.TestCase.assertEqual` does. – phihag Jul 1 '19 at 7:08

  * I took the nose approach here github.com/nose-devs/nose/blob/… to get the exact value. So I can keep the exception message meaning full – 0x2bad Jul 7 '19 at 17:31

The traceback module and sys.exc_info are overkill for tracking down the
source of an exception. That's all in the default traceback. So instead of
calling exit(1) just re-raise:

    
    
    try:
        assert ""birthday cake"" == ""ice cream cake"", ""Should've asked for pie""
    except AssertionError:
        print 'Houston, we have a problem.'
        raise
    

Which gives the following output that includes the offending statement and
line number:

    
    
    Houston, we have a problem.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""/tmp/poop.py"", line 2, in <module>
        assert ""birthday cake"" == ""ice cream cake"", ""Should've asked for pie""
    AssertionError: Should've asked for pie
    

Similarly the logging module makes it easy to log a traceback for any
exception (including those which are caught and never re-raised):

    
    
    import logging
    
    try:
        assert False == True 
    except AssertionError:
        logging.error(""Nothing is real but I can't quit..."", exc_info=True)

**IN THE MEDIA**
